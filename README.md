# KItchen duties Schedule Script (KISS)

---

This is an app that can be used in order to create a
printable timetable for carrying out kitchen duties in
shared households with numbered apartments.
---
## How to use it?
Suppose we have two systems:
1. students in the dormitory clean every weekend (30.08 - 1.09)
2. students in the dormitory clean during the week (26.08 - 3.09)  

In both cases, if you enter the initial dates (i.e. 30.08, 01.09 in the first case, and 26.08 - 3.09 in the second case),
the subsequent dates will be generated in a manner appropriate to the specified system.
